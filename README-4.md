##Overview
This project requires you to create a NLP project uses various webpack features, 
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles

- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

Instructions
- to run with webpack dev server, type "npm run build-dev-server"
- to build in dev mode, type "npm run build-dev" (if for some reason you do not want to trigger the dev server)
- to build in production mode, type "npm run build-prod"
- to run the app on port 8081, type "npm run start"

## Special Installation notes:
- Since this project uses some webpack 4 features which are depreciated, 
to ensure it works for you, you should use "npm i --leacy-peer-deps".
- Also, I have a git ignore .env file which I stored my API key. You should
go to www.meaningcloud.com to grab your own API key.
- Once you get your API key, replace the key value in .env.example and rename it to
.env
